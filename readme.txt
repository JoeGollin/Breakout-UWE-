Notes:

- Ball sometimes glitches on far right screen and top of screen I haven't been able to replicate it consistently,
  same issue with paddle.

- I've tried to figure out the collision with the side of the screen but I haven't been able
  to get it working fully.

- Can we get a live coding session on vector use for figuring out angles, please?
